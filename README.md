ue is a dedicated online platform for telling stories.

## How it works

The platform is going to look like YouTube but has a mix of different media formats, such as

-- Verify Stories and Users: Stories and users verified will be indicated as verified. A user can be verified without having their story verified. And a user can be unverified and still have a verified story. If the metrics of user verification are contact, email and phone verification, then all verified stories should come from a verified user. If the verification metrics include actual identity verification, such as government-issued ID or Bank verification, then not all verified stories might come from a verified user. Most likely, all verified stories should come from a verified user.
